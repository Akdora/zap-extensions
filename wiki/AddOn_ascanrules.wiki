The release quality Active Scanner rules.

The rules include:

=== Cross Site Scripting (Reflected) ===
This rule starts by submitting a 'safe' value and analysing all of the locations in which this value occurs in the response (if any).
It then performs a series of attacks specifically targeted at the location in which each of the instances occurs, including tag attributes, URL attributes, attributes in tags which support src attributes, html comments etc.
=== Directory browsing ===
=== External redirect ===
=== CRLF injection ===
=== Parameter tampering ===
=== Path Traversal ===
=== Secure page browser cache ===
=== Server side include ===
=== Session ID in URL rewrite ===
=== SQL Injection ===
This scanner scans for SQL Injection vulnerabilities in an RDBMS-independent fashion, by attacking url parameters and form parameters with fragments of valid and invalid SQL syntax, using error based, boolean based, Union based, and stacked query SQL Injection techniques. This scanner may be able to fingerprint the RDBMS if the application throws a known RDBMS specific SQL error message. This scanner does not exploit any RDBMS specific techniques, and so is the best SQL injection scanner to use as a starting point. 
=== URL Redirector Abuse ===
