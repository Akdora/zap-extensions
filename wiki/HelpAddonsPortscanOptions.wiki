=Options Port Scan screen=

This screen allows you to configure the port scan options: 
===Maximum port to scan===
ZAP will start from 1 and work up to this port number. <br>Selecting a high number will significantly increase 
the time a port scan takes. 
===Concurrent scanning threads per host===
The number of threads the scanner will use per host. <br>Increasing the number of threads will speed up the 
scan but may put extra strain on the computer ZAP is running on and the target host.
