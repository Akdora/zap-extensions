Server-Sent Events can be used by web applications or web sites to setup a uni-directional (one-way) 
communication channel over a single TCP connection. <br><br>You can use it for push notifications from a server 
to a browser client. Server-Sent Events sometimes provide an alternative to usages of Ajax, HTTP Long 
Polling or Comet. <br><br>In the browser you can use Server-Sent Events via the _EventSource API_. This API belongs 
to HTML5 and is standardized by the W3C: [http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/ http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/]
