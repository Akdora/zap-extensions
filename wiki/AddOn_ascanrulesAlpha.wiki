The alpha quality Active Scanner rules.

The rules include

=== Cross Site Scripting (Persistent) ===
This scanner injects 'safe' unique tokens into all available parameters.
It then spiders to see where these tokens appear on the site.
If it finds these tokens on any page it then attacks these parameters in a similar way to the reflected cross site scripting - targeting wherever they appear.
