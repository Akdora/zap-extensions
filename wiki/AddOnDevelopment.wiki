= Add-on Development =

This page gives an overview of the process of developing an add-on and getting it published.

==Implementation==

Not surprisingly the first thing to do (apart from deciding what to implement) is to create the first version of your add-on.

For help with that see:
  * [http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/wiki/Building Building ZAP]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/wiki/DevExtending Extending ZAP]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/wiki/ZapAddOns ZAP Add-ons]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/wiki/InternalDetails ZAP Internal Details]

==[AddOnsAlpha Alpha version]==
Once you have something you would like to publish you will need commit access to this project. If you dont already have it then ask on the [http://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop ZAP developer group] giving us a brief overview of your add-on

You should then add your code to the [https://code.google.com/p/zap-extensions/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Falpha alpha branch]

Let us know when you are happy with it (on the [http://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop dev group] again) and we'll give it an initial review.

This review will just be to check basic things like:
  * It builds(!)
  * It loads as an add-on in the latest released version of ZAP
  * It doesnt do anything obviously bad
As long as it passes those criteria then it will be released and available to instrall from within ZAP.
