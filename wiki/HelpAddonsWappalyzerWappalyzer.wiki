=Technology Detection using Wappalyzer=

The Technology Detection add-on uses the Wappalyzer (http://wappalyzer.com/) rules to detect the technologies 
used by applications.

It works in a very similar way to the Wappalyzer browser add-ons with the following exceptions: 
 * It does not use the 'Global JavaScript variables' as these are difficult to test without a 'full' browser
 * It does not use the 'meta tags'- this is still todo
 * It does not not show the versions - this is still todo
 * It does not not show the confidence - this is still todo
 * It allows you to see the 'evidence' used to detect the technologies
==The Technology Tab==
This tab shows all of the detected technologies for the site selected.<br>Right clicking on a technology 
will display a 'Show evidence' menu underneight which are all of the regexes used to detect it.<br>Selecting 
a regex will switch to the 'Search' tab and search through the history for that regex.
