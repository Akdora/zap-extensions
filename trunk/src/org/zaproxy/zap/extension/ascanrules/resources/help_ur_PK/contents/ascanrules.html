<h1>Active Scan Rules</h1>
The following release quality active scan rules are included in this add-on:

<h2>Code Injection</h2>

<h2>Command Injection</h2>

<h2>Client Browser Cache</h2>

This rule checks the headers of secure pages and reports an alert if they allow a browser to cache the page.

<h2>Cross Site Scripting (reflected)</h2>

This rule starts by submitting a 'safe' value and analyzing all of the locations in which this value occurs in the response (if any). <br>
It then performs a series of attacks specifically targeted at the location in which each of the instances occurs, 
including tag attributes, URL attributes, attributes in tags which support src attributes, html comments etc. 

<h2>Cross Site Scripting (persistent)</h2>

This rule starts by submitting a unique 'safe' value and then spiders the whole application to find all of the locations in which the value occurs.<br>
It then performs a series of attacks in the same way that the 'reflected' version does but in this case checks all of the 
target locations in other pages. 

<h2>Directory Browsing</h2>

<h2>External Redirect</h2>

<h2>CRLF Injection</h2>

<h2>Parameter Tampering</h2>

<h2>Path Traversal</h2>

<h2>Remote File Include</h2>

<h2>Server Side Include</h2>

<h2>SQL Injection</h2>

This scanner scans for SQL Injection vulnerabilities in an RDBMS-independent fashion, 
by attacking url parameters and form parameters with fragments of valid and invalid SQL syntax, using error based, 
boolean based, Union based, and stacked query SQL Injection techniques. <br>
This scanner may be able to fingerprint the RDBMS if the application throws a known RDBMS specific SQL error message. <br>
This scanner does not exploit any RDBMS specific techniques, and so is the best SQL injection scanner to use as a starting point.
