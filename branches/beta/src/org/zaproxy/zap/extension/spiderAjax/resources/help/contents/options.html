	This screen allows you to configure the
	<a href="concepts.html">AJAX Spider</a> options. The AJAX Spider is an add-on for a
	crawler called Crawljax. The add-on sets up a local proxy in ZAP to talk to Cralwjax.
	Therefore, you can configure the crawler.

	<h2>AJAX Spider Crawler Configuration</h2>
	You can configure the following parameters of Crawljax.
	<h3>Number of Browser Windows</h3>
	You can configure the number of windows to be used by AJAX Spider. The more windows, the
	faster the process will be.
	<h3>Browser</h3>
	<p>AJAX Spider relies on an external browser to crawl the targeted site. You can
		specify which one you want to use: Firefox, Chrome or HtmlUnit.</p>
	<p>HtmlUnit is an embedded java based browser included in AJAX Spider.</p>
	<p>If you use Firefox or Chrome, you must have it installed in your system.</p>
	<p>
		Chrome requires a specific package to run, called Chrome Driver. <br> If you want
		to use Chrome, you should install it. For more information refer to
		http://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/downloads/list
	</p>
	<h3>Select ChromeDriver</h3>
	<p>Allows to select the location of the Chrome Driver.</p>
	<h3>Crawl in depth</h3>
	If you enable this option, more HTML tags will be analyzed to find new links. Following tags will be analyzed: a, button, td, 
	span, div, tr, ol, li, radio, form, select, input, option, img, p, abbr, address, area, article, aside, audio, canvas, details, 
	footer, header, label, nav, section, summary, table, textarea, th, ul, video. This usually improves overall results but slows down the process.
	<h3>Maximum crawl depth</h3>
	The maximum depth that the crawler can reach. The default is 10. Unlimited depth is zero.
	<h3>Maximum crawl states</h3>
	The maximum number of states that the crawler should crawl. The default is unlimited. Unlimited crawl states is zero.
	<h3>Maximum duration</h3>
	The maximum time that the crawler should run. Default is one hour. Unlimited running time is zero. Crawler will stop if one of other limiting conditions is reached.
	<h3>Event wait time</h3>
	The time to wait after an event is fired.  Default is 1000 milliseconds.
	<h3>Reload wait time</h3>
