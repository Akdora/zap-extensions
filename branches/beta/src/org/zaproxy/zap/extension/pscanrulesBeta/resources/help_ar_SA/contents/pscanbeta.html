<h1>Passive Scan Rules - Beta</h1>
The following beta quality passive scan rules are included in this add-on:

<h2>Charset Mismatch</h2>
This check identifies responses where the HTTP Content-Type header declares a charset different from the charset defined by the body of the HTML or XML. When there's a charset mismatch between the HTTP header and content body Web browsers can be forced into an undesirable content-sniffing mode to determine the content's correct character set.

<h2>Cookie - Loosely Scoped</h2>
Cookies can be scoped by domain or path. This check is only concerned with domain scope.The domain scope applied to a cookie determines which domains can access it. For example, a cookie can be scoped strictly to a subdomain e.g. www.nottrusted.com, or loosely scoped to a parent domain e.g. nottrusted.com. In the latter case, any subdomain of nottrusted.com can access the cookie. Loosely scoped cookies are common in mega-applications like google.com and live.com.

<h2>CSRF Countermeasures</h2>

<h2>Information Disclosure: In URL</h2>

<h2>Information Disclosure: Referrer</h2>
