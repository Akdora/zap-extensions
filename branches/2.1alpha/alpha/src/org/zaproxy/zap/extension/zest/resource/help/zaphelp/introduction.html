<p>
Zest is a specialized scripting language developed by the Mozilla security team and is intended to be used in web oriented security tools.
<p>
It is completely free, open source and can be included in any tool whether open or closed, free or commercial.
<p>
Version 1 of Zest:
<ul>
    <li>Is aimed at creating scripts for reproducing basic security vulnerabilities</li>
    <li>Includes a Java reference implementation</li>
    <li>Has been included in a proof-of-concept OWASP ZAP add-on</li>
</ul>

Zest scripts are written in JSON, but the expectation is that scripts will be written using graphical interfaces.
<p>
While Zest can have many uses we have focused on one particular use case for the first version: <a href="usecase1.html">reproducing security vulnerabilities</a>
<p>
For details of the Zest Java reference implementation command line options see: <a href="commandline.html">Command Line</a>.
<p>
For more technical details about Zest see: <a href="core/core.html">Zest Core</a>.
<p>
The first version of Zest is intentionally very basic. Future versions of Zest are planned which will significantly increase the scope of the language.
<p>
All constructive feedback is very welcome.
<p>
Anyone can contribute to the onward development of Zest, and teams or individuals who develop security tools are especially welcome to join and help shape Zest's future.
