cookielooselyscoped.name=Loosely Scoped Cookie
# Description
cookielooselyscoped.desc=Cookies can be scoped by domain or path. This check \
is only concerned with domain scope.The domain scope applied to a cookie \
determines which domains can access it. For example, a cookie can be scoped \
strictly to a subdomain e.g. www.nottrusted.com, or loosely scoped to a parent \
domain e.g. nottrusted.com. In the latter case, any subdomain of \
nottrusted.com can access the cookie. Loosely scoped cookies are common in \
mega-applications like google.com and live.com.
# Solution
cookielooselyscoped.soln=Always scope cookies to a FQDN (Fully Qualified \
Domain Name).
# Attack
cookielooselyscoped.exploit=Cookies set from a subdomain like app.foo.bar are \
transmitted only to that domain by the browser. However, cookies scoped to a \
parent-level domain may be transmitted to the parent, or any subdomain of the \
parent.
