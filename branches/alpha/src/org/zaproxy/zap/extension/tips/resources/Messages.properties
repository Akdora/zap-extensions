# The actual tips and tricks - anything with a key stating 'tips.tip.' will be treated as a tip
# General tips
tips.tip.gen.001 = Save your ZAP session at the start of a test rather than at the end - the session is stored in a db which will be updated all of the time so you wont have to save it again.
tips.tip.gen.002 = Try different UI layouts via the buttons on the main toolbar.
tips.tip.gen.003 = Right click everywhere.\n\
Highlight text and right click it.\n\
A lot of ZAP functionality is context sensitive as best accessed this way.
tips.tip.gen.004 = Use keyboard shortcuts to speed up your testing - you can define your own combinations via 'Options / Keyboard' which also generates printable shortcut cheatsheets.
tips.tip.gen.005 = If you are getting too many false positives try changing the threshold for that scan rule to High.\n\
But also report the problem to us via the ZAP Users Group or Issues so we can investigate it - both of which are linked off the 'Online' menu
tips.tip.gen.006 = Still using Filters? These are being phased out and will be removed in the future.\n\
Use scripts instead - they are much more powerful.
tips.tip.gen.007 = Add your target application to a Context using the 'right click' menu: 'Include in Context'.\n\
This allows you tell ZAP more about the target, such as the authentication, the users and the technology it uses.
tips.tip.gen.008 = ZAP can display, intercept and even fuzz client side messages including postMessages - 'right click' a subtree in the Sites tree and select a suitable submenu under 'Monitor clients'.\n\
Force a browser refresh and your open pages will be displayed in the 'Clients' tab along with all of the client side messages they generate.
tips.tip.gen.009 = Zest scripts are a great way to automate tasks.\n\
Zest is ZAP's graphical macro language, but provides programming features like conditionals and loops.\n\
Use the 'Record a new Zest script...' button on the main toolbar to quickly record a new Zest script.\n\
You can also 'right click' requests to add them to Zest scripts.
tips.tip.gen.010 = ZAP can automatically check for updates - turn it on via the 'Options / Check for Updates' screen.\n\
If you dont want it to happen automatically then make sure you manually check for updates frequently via the 'Manage Add-ons' main toolbar button as we continually add new features and fix issues.
tips.tip.gen.011 = Click on the 'gear' icon on the right hand side of many tabs to quickly access the setting for that feature. 

# Obscure features
tips.tip.obs.001 = POST requests have a 'right click' menu for generating an anti CSRF test form
tips.tip.obs.002 = The 'Show / enable' fields 'lightbulb' button on the main toolbar will make hidden fields visible and allow you to edit disabled fields.
tips.tip.obs.003 = Does your application use anti CSRF tokens?\n\
Make sure you have configured ZAP to handle them via the 'Options / Active Scan' screen.
tips.tip.obs.004 = You can compare 2 requests or responses by selecting them both, 'right clicking' and selecting one of the 'Compare 2..' menu items.

# Optional add-ons
tips.tip.add.001 = Install the beta active and passive scan rules to find more potential issues.\n\
There are also alpha active and passive scan rules but obviously they may be less stable.
tips.tip.add.002 = Want to script ZAP in a scripting language other than Java Script and Zest?\n\
Check the ZAP Marketplace for other languages like python and ruby.\n\
If your preferred scripting language isnt yet available then get in touch - its fairly easy to add support for other languages.
tips.tip.add.003 = Install the SAML Extension form the ZAP Marketplace to detect, show, edit and fuzz SAML requests.

# 2.4 specific tips (to be un-commented prior to 2.4 being released
#tips.tip.gen.xxx = The majority of ZAP's tabs are now hidden by default so that the UI is less cluttered.\n\
#You can show and hide all of the tabs via buttons on the main toolbar.\n\
#You can also 'pin' any tab you like so that it stays visible even after a restart.
