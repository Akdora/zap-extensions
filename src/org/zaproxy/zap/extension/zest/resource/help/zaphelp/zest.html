<p>
Zest is an experimental specialized scripting language (also known as a domain-specific language) 
developed by the Mozilla security team and is intended to be used in web oriented security tools.
<p>
It is included by default with the Scripts add-on.<br>
To create a new Zest script:
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the Scripts tree tab</li>
<li>Type in a suitable name for your script</li>
<li>Select the script type (see the Scripts add-o help page for more details)</li>
<li>Select the Zest script engine</li>
<li>Select one of the templates</li>
<li>Press the 'Save' button</li>
</ul>
<H2>Editing Zest scripts</H2>
Zest scripts are edited graphically in the Scripts tree tab.<br>
Each statement is a node in the tree - double click nodes to edit the statement properties.<br>
You can add, move and remove statements via right clicking the Zest nodes.<br>
You can also add requests to 'Stand alone' Zest scripts by right clicking the requests in any of the other tabs.<br>
There are also some right click options available when you select text in the Request or Response tabs.
