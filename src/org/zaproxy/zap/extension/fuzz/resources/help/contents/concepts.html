<H1>Fuzzing</H1>
<p>
Fuzzing is a technique of submitting lots of invalid or unexpected data to a target.
</p>
<p>
ZAP allows you to fuzz any request still using a built in set of payloads.<br/>
To fuzz a request string:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Select a request in the Sites or History tab</li>
<li>Highlight the string you wish to fuzz in the Request tab</li>
<li>Right click in the Request tab and select 'Fuzz...'</li>
<li>Add payloads and new locations</li>
<li>Press the Start Fuzzer button</li>
<li>The results will then be listed in the <a href="tab.html">Fuzzer tab</a> select them to see the full requests and responses.</li>
</ul>
You can also search for strings in the fuzz results using the 'Search tab'.
<p>
Fuzzing is configured using the 
<a href="options.html">Options Fuzzing screen</a>. Additional fuzzing files can be added via this screen 
or can be put manually into the "fuzzers" directory where ZAP was installed - they will then become available after restarting ZAP.
</p>
<p>
This functionality is based on code from the OWASP JBroFuzz project and includes files from the fuzzdb project.<br/>
Note that some fuzzdb files have been left out as they cause common anti virus scanners to flag them as containing viruses.<br/>
You can replace them (and upgrade fuzzdb) by downloading the latest version of fuzzdb and expanding it in the 'fuzzers' library.
