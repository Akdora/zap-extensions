pscanrules.xss-protection.extrainfo = The X-XSS-Protection HTTP response header allows the web server to enable or disable the web browser's XSS protection mechanism. The following values would attempt to enable it: \nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\nX-XSS-Protection: 1; report=http://www.example.com/xss\nThe following values would disable it:\nX-XSS-Protection: 0\nThe X-XSS-Protection HTTP response header is currently supported on Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari (WebKit).\nNote that this alert is only raised if the response body could potentially contain an XSS payload (with a text-based content type, with a non-zero length).
pscanrules.xss-protection.soln = Ensure that the web browser's XSS filter is enabled, by setting the X-XSS-Protection HTTP response header to '1'.

pscanrules.xframeoptionsscanner.soln = Most modern Web browsers support the X-Frame-Options HTTP header. Ensure it's set on all web pages returned by your site (if you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY.  ALLOW-FROM allows specific websites to frame the web page in supported web browsers).
