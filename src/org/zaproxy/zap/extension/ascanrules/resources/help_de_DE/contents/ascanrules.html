<h1>Active Scan Rules</h1>
The following release quality active scan rules are included in this add-on:

<h2>Code Injection</h2>

This rule submits PHP and ASP attack strings as values for URL parameters in a request and examines the response to 
see if those values have been evaluated by the server. First, requests are constructed and sent containing injected PHP instructions
to print a token. In the event of a match between the token and the content of the response body, the scanner raises an alert and returns immediately.
If there aren't any matches, the scanner will construct requests with several injected ASP strings that instruct the server to write the product
of two randomly generated integers in the response. If the body of the response matches the product, an alert is raised.

<h2>Command Injection</h2>

This rule submits *NIX and Windows OS commands as URL parameter values to determine whether or not the web application is passing unchecked
user input directly to the underlying OS. The injection strings consist of meta-characters that may be interpreted by the OS
as join commands along with a payload that should generate output in the response if the application is vulnerable. If the content of a response body
matches the payload, the scanner raises an alert and returns immediately. In the event that none of the error-based matching attempts
return output in the response, the scanner will attempt a blind injection attack by submitting sleep instructions as the payload and comparing the elapsed time between sending the request
and receiving the response against a heuristic time-delay lower limit. If the elapsed time is greater than this limit, an alert is raised with medium confidence
and the scanner returns immediately.

<h2>Client Browser Cache</h2>

This rule checks the headers of secure pages and reports an alert if they allow a browser to cache the page.

<h2>Cross Site Scripting (reflected)</h2>

This rule starts by submitting a 'safe' value and analyzing all of the locations in which this value occurs in the response (if any). <br>
It then performs a series of attacks specifically targeted at the location in which each of the instances occurs, 
including tag attributes, URL attributes, attributes in tags which support src attributes, html comments etc. 

<h2>Cross Site Scripting (persistent)</h2>

This rule starts by submitting a unique 'safe' value and then spiders the whole application to find all of the locations in which the value occurs.<br>
It then performs a series of attacks in the same way that the 'reflected' version does but in this case checks all of the 
target locations in other pages. 

<h2>Directory Browsing</h2>

<h2>External Redirect</h2>

<h2>CRLF Injection</h2>

<h2>Parameter Tampering</h2>

<h2>Path Traversal</h2>

<h2>Remote File Include</h2>

<h2>Server Side Include</h2>

<h2>SQL Injection</h2>

This scanner scans for SQL Injection vulnerabilities in an RDBMS-independent fashion, 
by attacking url parameters and form parameters with fragments of valid and invalid SQL syntax, using error based, 
boolean based, Union based, and stacked query SQL Injection techniques. <br>
This scanner may be able to fingerprint the RDBMS if the application throws a known RDBMS specific SQL error message. <br>
This scanner does not exploit any RDBMS specific techniques, and so is the best SQL injection scanner to use as a starting point.
